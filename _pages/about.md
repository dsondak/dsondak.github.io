I am a Research and Development Software Engineer in the Integrated Multiphysics group at Dassault Syst&egrave;mes
Simulia Corp.  Prior to this, I was a Lecturer in Computational Science in the Institute for Applied Computational Science
(IACS) at Harvard University where I conducted research and taught classes. My research is at the intersection of applied
mathematics, physics, and machine learning with an emphasis on fluid mechanics and multiscale phenomena. At IACS, I taught
classes on basic software principles (CS207), high performance computing (CS205, AC290r), and fluid mechanics (ES123). I also
led a version of the capstone course (AC297r) which requires students to work closely with industrial and academic partners
to solve real-world problems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
